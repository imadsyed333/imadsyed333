<h1>
  Hi, my name is Imad.
</h1>
I am a software developer dedicated to building solutions that solve real problems. 

I'm mainly a frontend guy — TypeScript, React, Material UI — but I have been growing into the backend with Node, Express, and FastAPI.

Check out my pinned projects, especially [MOVE](https://github.com/CityofToronto/bdit_flashcrow) (also known as `bdit_flashcrow`). It's an open source web app for Toronto traffic analytics. I had a lot of fun contributing to it.

I'm currently working on [CrashLog](https://github.com/imadsyed333/crashlog). It's a cross-platform mobile app which makes it easy for drivers to log critical info after a vehicle collision.

Feel free to shoot me a message on any of my socials!
